# Welcome to the Unity Portion of my Uken Games Interview.

## The core deliverables for this project are as follows:
1.  Import the Trash Dash Project from the Unity Asset Store
2.  Increase lives from 3 to 5 (make sure 5 hearts appear on the scene and are being calculated properly during the game session).
3.  Increase the amount of active missions from 2 to 4 in the Mission List.
4.  Create a repo on github and commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
5.  Add a detailed instruction on how to setup/launch your project.

## To open this project you will need:
1. Unity Hub
2. Unity Version 2020.3.5f1
3. an IDE that can read C# scripts + extensions.

Once you've chosen where you'll place the repository, go into your directory and find 

```\Unity_Uken_Games\Uken_Unity\Assets\Scenes\Main```

Open that file using the Unity Editor (if you do not see this option that means you don't have the correct unity version installed!)
Once you've opened the file you're done!
now you can simply Build and run for the supported platforms or tweak the game further for your own uses.
